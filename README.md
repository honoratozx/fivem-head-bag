## üé≠ FiveM Head Bag Interaction System

**Head Bag Interaction System** is a professional, lightweight script for FiveM that allows players to apply or remove head bags on other players via a clean and intuitive menu. Perfect for roleplay servers, it provides realistic interactions, visual overlays, and full client-server management for a smooth and safe gameplay experience.
This script is built using the **ESX framework**, is modular, easy to configure, and fully extendable for future features.

## ‚ú® Features

* [x] Apply a head bag to nearby players using an in-game menu.
* [x] Remove head bags from players who already have one applied.
* [x] Clean and professional NUI overlay for visual indication.
* [x] Triggered via a usable item (e.g., `headbag`) for easy activation.
* [x] Client-server architecture for secure, synchronized application.
* [x] In-game notifications for professional player feedback.
* [x] Fully modular design for easy extension and maintenance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Detect Nearby Players:**
   The script detects players within a 2-meter radius and allows applying or removing a head bag.

2. **Apply Head Bag:**
   A head bag object (`prop_money_bag_01`) is created and attached to the target player‚Äôs head with proper coordinates and rotation for a realistic appearance.

3. **Overlay Display:**
   The NUI overlay automatically displays when a head bag is applied, providing a clean visual indicator.

4. **Remove Head Bag:**
   Head bags can be safely removed either by the player themselves or by another player, ensuring smooth interactions.

5. **Persistent Handling:**
   The head bag is automatically removed on player respawn (`playerSpawned`) to prevent glitches or ghost objects.
